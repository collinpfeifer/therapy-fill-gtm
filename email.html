      <p>Hi {name},</p>
      <p>
          When I would talk to therapists, cancellations kept coming up as a concern.

          <p>Usually the options would be:</p>

          <ol>
              <li>Seeing more clients</li>
              <li>Instituting higher cancellation fees or stricter policies</li>
              <li>Shuffling clients around to make it work</li>
          </ol>

          <p>But therapists werenâ€™t happy with those options.</p>

          <p>
              To remedy this, I built <a href={tracking_link}>TherapyFill</a>, a cancellation platform that will field cancellation requests, work to reschedule them and find a replacement from your current caseload.
